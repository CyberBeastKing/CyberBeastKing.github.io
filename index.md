üåê Portfolio Website: https://cyberbeastking.github.io/

**Entry-Level SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Professional in Training**

Passionate about protecting organizations through threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. Currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate while building a home SOC lab with Linux, Splunk, and Security Onion. Hands-on practice includes analyzing suspicious logins, documenting incidents, and performing basic vulnerability assessments.

I bring consistency, energy, and a growth mindset ‚Äî ready to contribute to a SOC team on Day One.

## üìä Projects

### Project 1 ‚Äî Web Traffic Analysis with Splunk
A security-focused dashboard built from custom web logs to show how I ingest data, write SPL, and design visualizations.

**Data**
- **Index:** `project1`
- **Sourcetype:** `web:logs`
- **File:** `web_logs.log` (sample HTTP access logs)

**Screenshot**

**<summary>See SPL Queries - **Click to Expand**</summary>**

#### 1) HTTP Status Codes
```spl
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| stats count by status
| sort - count
```
#### 2) Requests by URL
```sql
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| stats count by url
| sort - count
```
#### 3) Requests Over Time by Status
```sql
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| timechart span=10m count by status
```
#### 4) Top Source IPs
```sql
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| stats count by src_ip
| sort - count
```

<h2>SQL Log Analysis ‚Äì Suspicious Logins</h2>

This project simulates a **brute-force login investigation** using SQL queries on employee login data. The goal was to detect failed login attempts, external access, and suspicious login patterns.

**Dataset**

A synthetic `employee_logins` table with:

`username` ‚Äì Employee username

`login_time` ‚Äì Timestamp of login

`ip_addres`s ‚Äì Source IP

`status` ‚Äì SUCCESS / FAILED

<details>

**<summary>See SQL Queries - **Click to Expand**</summary>**
  
  #### 1) All Login Records
  ```sql
  SELECT * 
FROM employee_logins
ORDER BY login_time;
```
#### 2)External Logins (Outside Internal IP Range)
```sql
SELECT id, username, login_time, ip_address, status
FROM employee_logins
WHERE ip_address NOT LIKE '192.168.%'
  AND ip_address NOT LIKE '10.%'
  AND ip_address NOT LIKE '172.16.%'
ORDER BY login_time;
```
#### 3)First Failed ‚Üí First Success (Suspicious Sequence)
```sql
WITH first_failed AS (
  SELECT username, MIN(login_time) AS first_failed_time
  FROM employee_logins
  WHERE status = 'FAILED'
  GROUP BY username
),
first_success AS (
  SELECT username, MIN(login_time) AS first_success_time
  FROM employee_logins
  WHERE status = 'SUCCESS'
  GROUP BY username
)
SELECT f.username, f.first_failed_time, s.first_success_time
FROM first_failed f
JOIN first_success s ON f.username = s.username;
```
#### 4) Failed Attempts per IP
```sql
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) AS failed_count
FROM employee_logins
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
GROUP BY ip_address
ORDER BY failed_count DESC, ip_address;
```
#### 5) Logins Over Time (by Hour)
```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:00', login_time) AS hour_bucket,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS success_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'FAILED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_count
FROM employee_logins
GROUP BY hour_bucket
ORDER BY hour_bucket;
```
#### 6) Failed Attempts per User
```sql
SELECT username, COUNT(*) AS failed_attempts
FROM employee_logins
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY failed_attempts DESC, username;
```
</details>

## üö© Findings

- Multiple failed logins from `192.168.1.11` and `10.0.0.5`.

- User `jdoe` and `admin` showed repeated failures before eventual success ‚Äî common brute-force pattern.

- External logins from `203.0.113.55 (mary)` indicate possible compromise from outside the network.
