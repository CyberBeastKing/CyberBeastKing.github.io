## 📊 Projects

### Web Traffic Analysis with Splunk
- **Goal:** Build a security-focused dashboard to analyze simulated web traffic logs.  
- **Setup:**  
  - Created a custom log file (`web_logs.log`) with realistic HTTP requests.  
  - Ingested logs into Splunk with a custom sourcetype (`web:logs`) and index (`project1`).  
- **Dashboard Panels:**  
  - **HTTP Status Codes** – breakdown of successful vs failed requests (200, 401, 403).  
  - **Requests by URL** – which endpoints are accessed most often (`/index.html`, `/admin`, `/login.php`).  
  - **Requests Over Time** – visualize traffic patterns and errors across time.  
- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Splunk ingestion & indexing  
  - SPL queries (search, stats, table, timechart)  
  - Security monitoring concepts (failed login attempts, restricted URL access)  
  - Dashboard creation & visualization polish
