🌐 Portfolio Website: [https://cyberbeastking.github.io/](https://cyberbeastking.github.io/)

**Entry-Level SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Professional in Training**

Passionate about protecting organizations through threat detection, log analysis, and incident response. Currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate while building a home SOC lab with Linux, Splunk, and Security Onion. Hands-on practice includes analyzing suspicious logins, documenting incidents, and performing basic vulnerability assessments.  

I bring consistency, energy, and a growth mindset — ready to contribute to a SOC team on Day One.

## 📊 Projects  

### [Web Traffic Analysis with Splunk](./project1/README.md)  
A security-focused dashboard built from custom web logs to show how I ingest data, write SPL, and design visualizations.  

**Data**  
- **Index:** `project1`  
- **Sourcetype:** `web:logs`  
- **File:** `web_logs.log` (sample HTTP access logs)

## <summary>See SPL Queries</summary>

#### 1) HTTP Status Codes
```spl
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| stats count by status
| sort - count
```
Requests by URL
```sql
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| stats count by url
| sort - count
```
Requests Over Time by Status
```sql
index=project1 sourcetype=web:logs
| timechart span=10m count by status
```
Top Source IPs
```sql

<h2>SQL Log Analysis – Suspicious Logins</h2>

This project simulates a **brute-force login investigation** using SQL queries on employee login data. The goal was to detect failed login attempts, external access, and suspicious login patterns.

**Dataset**

A synthetic `employee_logins` table with:

`username` – Employee username

`login_time` – Timestamp of login

`ip_addres`s – Source IP

`status` – SUCCESS / FAILED

**Screenshots**

Screenshot 1 – All login records

Screenshot 2 – External logins

Screenshot 3 – Failed → Success sequence

Screenshot 4 – Failed attempts per IP

Screenshot 5 – Logins over time (by hour)

Screenshot 6 – Failed attempts per user

<details>

## <summary>See SQL Queries</summary>
  
  All Login Records
  ```sql
  SELECT * 
FROM employee_logins
ORDER BY login_time;
```
External Logins (Outside Internal IP Range)
```sql
SELECT id, username, login_time, ip_address, status
FROM employee_logins
WHERE ip_address NOT LIKE '192.168.%'
  AND ip_address NOT LIKE '10.%'
  AND ip_address NOT LIKE '172.16.%'
ORDER BY login_time;
```
First Failed → First Success (Suspicious Sequence)
```sql
WITH first_failed AS (
  SELECT username, MIN(login_time) AS first_failed_time
  FROM employee_logins
  WHERE status = 'FAILED'
  GROUP BY username
),
first_success AS (
  SELECT username, MIN(login_time) AS first_success_time
  FROM employee_logins
  WHERE status = 'SUCCESS'
  GROUP BY username
)
SELECT f.username, f.first_failed_time, s.first_success_time
FROM first_failed f
JOIN first_success s ON f.username = s.username;
```
Failed Attempts per IP
```sql
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) AS failed_count
FROM employee_logins
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
GROUP BY ip_address
ORDER BY failed_count DESC, ip_address;
```
Logins Over Time (by Hour)
```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:00', login_time) AS hour_bucket,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS success_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'FAILED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_count
FROM employee_logins
GROUP BY hour_bucket
ORDER BY hour_bucket;
```
Failed Attempts per User
```sql
SELECT username, COUNT(*) AS failed_attempts
FROM employee_logins
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY failed_attempts DESC, username;
```
</details>

## 🚩 Findings

Multiple failed logins from 192.168.1.11 and 10.0.0.5.

User jdoe and admin showed repeated failures before eventual success — common brute-force pattern.

External logins from 203.0.113.55 (mary) indicate possible compromise from outside the network.
